## The Challenge

Identifying inefficiencies in existing workflows and handling large-scale datasets was the primary hurdle. 
The data was unstructured, requiring significant cleaning and normalization before analysis could begin.

## The Solution

Leveraging Python for data processing and SQL for querying, we built a robust pipeline. 
Power BI was utilized to visualize the results, providing stakeholders with real-time insights.
